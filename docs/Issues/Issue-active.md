# Active Issues

Issues awaiting **user verification**. An Issue leaves this file only when the user verifies it
(→ `Verified/Issue-verified-XXXX-YYYY.md`, batched in decades of ten) or approves its closure
(→ `Closed/`).

**Claude may mark an Issue `Resolved - Not Verified`. Only the user can mark it Verified.**

| ID | Title | Severity | Sprint | Status |
| -- | ----- | -------- | ------ | ------ |
| I-0140 | `[Apple]` ⚠️ **Swift RESTATES the world-scope rule instead of deriving it.** `ObjectCard.swift:46` reads `var isWorldScoped: Bool { kind != "source" }` — a hand-written partition of `ObjectKind` in Swift. CLAUDE.md's standing rule calls this **"a defect on sight, even when it is currently correct"**, and it is correct *only* because `source` happens to be the sole project-scoped kind today. ⚠️ **This is the SAME SITE CLASS as SP-104's occurrence, which blocked object creation in the app entirely.** ⚠️ **The cause is STRUCTURAL, not careless:** `grep` over `scrivi.h` shows **no endpoint exposes a kind's scope at all** — there is no `scrivi_list_object_kinds` and no scope field anywhere in the ABI, so **Swift cannot derive what the boundary never tells it.** ✅ **Fix is already RULED — design doc D5:** ScriviCore exposes each kind and whether it is world-scoped, derived from `kAllStorableKinds` + `objectKindIsWorldScoped()`; Swift then derives. ⚠️ **Test against `scrivi_*`, not the facade** (`feedback_boundary_tests_not_facade`) — that is how I-0113 shipped green. | **Medium** | **SP-116** (D5) | 🔴 **Open (2026-08-20)** — filed by **T-0424**; ⚠️ **FILED, NOT FIXED by design** — fixing it inside a five-Issue sprint would blur SP-115's boundary |
| I-0141 | `[ScriviCore]` ⚠️ **`scrivi.h:97-99`'s world-scope list has been STALE since 2026-08-14.** The Object-CRUD header comment still reads *"`worldID` … names the world a WORLD-SCOPED object lives in — artifact / chronicle / faction / rule. Pass "" (or NULL) for the project-scoped kinds, which is every other kind."* ⚠️ **SP-103 moved `character`, `location`, `item`, `building`, `vehicle` and `map` to world scope**, so the comment names **4 of 10** world-scoped kinds and its second sentence is now actively wrong — a reader who trusts it will pass `""` for a character and get `worldRequired`. ⚠️ **This is the documented failure mode exactly** — *"a list rots without being edited"*: nobody touched this comment; a kind's scope changed underneath it. **Occurrence EIGHT** of the restated-kind-list class. **Fix:** state the rule by reference to `objectKindIsWorldScoped()` rather than enumerating kinds, so it cannot rot again. | Low | **SP-116** | 🔴 **Open (2026-08-20)** — filed by **T-0424**; ⚠️ **FILED, NOT FIXED by design** (SP-115 scope ruling) |

**Currently: 2 Issues open — both FILED by T-0424 for SP-116, neither fixed by design.**

| Issue | Sev | Sprint | What |
| ----- | --- | ------ | ---- |
| I-0140 | Medium | **SP-116** | Swift **restates** the world-scope rule (`ObjectCard.swift:46`) — ⚠️ structural: no ABI endpoint exposes kind scope |
| I-0141 | Low | **SP-116** | `scrivi.h:97-99` world-scope list **stale since SP-103** — **occurrence eight** |

⚠️ **Both are cured by the same fix** — design-doc **D5**'s kind-scope endpoint, which lets Swift *derive*
scope instead of restating it. **Test it against `scrivi_*`, not the facade** — a facade test cannot see a
boundary gap, which is how I-0113 shipped green.

## ✅ SP-115 — all six Issues Verified 2026-08-20

| Issue | Sev | Task | Archive |
| ----- | --- | ---- | ------- |
| **I-0137** | **High** | T-0419 | [`Verified/Issue-verified-0131-0140.md`](Verified/Issue-verified-0131-0140.md) |
| I-0136 | Medium | T-0420 | same |
| I-0139 | Medium | T-0421 | same |
| I-0135 | Low | T-0422 | same |
| I-0138 | Low | T-0423 | same |
| **I-0142** | **High** | T-0425 | [`Verified/Issue-verified-0141-0150.md`](Verified/Issue-verified-0141-0150.md) |

⚠️ **I-0137 was verified on the REAL RIG** with the drive ejected — the check a passing suite genuinely
cannot substitute for.

⚠️ **I-0136 is Verified at the CORE ONLY.** Nothing in Scrivi surfaces `unsupportedWorldFormatVersion`, so
a writer opening a too-new world still sees *"unavailable"* with **no explanation**. The core refuses
correctly; **the writer-facing half does not exist** — `project_capability_without_surface` inside the very
sprint that fixed four other instances. **Owed a surface in a later sprint.**

⚠️ **I-0142 was found by the USER, not a suite** — and its unseen half (**renaming any world object
failed**) was worse than the reported symptom.

*Last Updated: 2026-08-20 (**SP-115's six Issues ✅ VERIFIED by the user and ARCHIVED in the same step** —
I-0135–I-0139 → `Verified/Issue-verified-0131-0140.md`, **I-0142 → a new decade file
`Issue-verified-0141-0150.md`.** Open Issues 8 → 2 (**I-0140, I-0141** — filed for SP-116, unfixed by
design). ⚠️ **I-0137 verified on the real rig, drive ejected.** ⚠️ **I-0136 verified at the CORE ONLY — its
writer-facing surface does not exist and is owed.** Suites: ctest **525/525** · interop **103/103** · app
**BUILD SUCCEEDED**. Next available Issue: **I-0143**. Prior note follows.)*

*Last Updated: 2026-08-20 (**SP-115 implemented — all five Issues 🟢 Resolved - Not Verified**, and
⚠️ **I-0140 + I-0141 FILED by T-0424** (restated-kind-list class, occurrence eight → **SP-116**, cured by
D5). Suites: `ctest` **524/524** (was 520) · macOS interop **103/103 in 10 suites** (was 99) · app
**BUILD SUCCEEDED**. ⚠️ **I-0137 still needs the REAL-RIG check** — drive ejected — before it can be
Verified. Open Issues 5 → 7. Next available Issue: **I-0142**. Prior note follows.)*

*Last Updated: 2026-08-20 (**All five open Issues ASSIGNED to SP-115** 🟡 Active under **EP-034** — one
Task each, T-0419–T-0423. ✅ **Two carried rulings recorded**: **D9 = A** for I-0137
(`lastKnownPackagePath`, distinctly named; `packagePath` NOT widened) and **Q-b** for I-0139 (**patch the
control** — the Detail Sheet does **not** replace the inline editor, so it is a real fix). ⚠️ **I-0140 and
I-0141 to be FILED by T-0424.** Next available Issue: **I-0142** after that filing. Prior note follows.)*

*Last Updated: 2026-08-19 (**T-0390 + T-0418 filed five Issues — I-0135…I-0139.** The live pass on the
real USB rig **passed steps 3, 4 and 5**: ⚠️ **AC23's no-intervention clause HELD** — reattaching the drive
restored every card with no click, no menu, no relaunch. Step 1 confirmed **all ten world kinds
round-trip** (the four directories absent since before SP-104 were created on demand); ⚠️ **`source` could
not be created — no UI exists, the known EP-034 gap.** Step 2 was **blocked**: relating from an object card
opens an editor whose exit is labelled "Revert" (I-0139). Findings: **I-0137 (High)** — AC24's refinement
**cannot fire on real hardware**; **I-0138** — disabled-but-unexplained removal; **I-0139** — the editor
exit. Next available: **I-0140**. Prior note follows.)*

*2026-08-18, fourth pass (✅ **I-0132 VERIFIED (user-approved) and re-archived** — both
halves, on an extended live click-through: *"I clicked about a lot and saw no missed clicks or focus
changes."* It took **four** attempts; the first three misdiagnosed it as a first-responder race and
each made the failure rarer rather than fixing it. ⚠️ **The user stopped the fourth before it was
written** — I was about to add an `NSEvent` monitor, reaching further below SwiftUI to win a fight
created by reaching below it in the first place — and redirected to the actual question: *what is the
source of truth, and does it propagate through the View hierarchy?* **The real defect was a one-shot
`navigateToSceneID` trigger**, not responder arbitration: re-selecting the same scene wrote an
unchanged value and SwiftUI coalesced the update away. macOS now uses the selection-as-source-of-truth
shape iOS already had. A **user-prompted loop audit** then replaced a fragile value-equality guard
with explicit echo suppression, plus **two regression tests proven non-vacuous**. Interop **95/95
macOS arm64**. Active count: **2** (I-0133 Resolved-Not-Verified, I-0134 Open). Prior note follows.)*

*2026-08-18, third pass (⚠️ **I-0132 RETURNED FROM VERIFIED — I archived it on a claim
that was not true.** The user verified focus changing **on app launch**, and said so explicitly; I
recorded that as verifying **click-to-focus** as well. Clicking a scene still left focus in the
navigator. **Cause was a responder race, not a missing call:** `takeFocus` ran
`makeFirstResponder` synchronously from inside `onTapGesture`, and the `NSTableView` backing SwiftUI's
`List` reclaimed first responder while finishing its own mouse-down. Launch had no competing responder
change, which is exactly why the two cases diverged — **the evidence I verified against and the
failing case were different code paths.** Second fix defers the transfer one runloop pass. The
**reveal half stays verified** and remains archived. **Lesson recorded:** when a fix has two halves,
verify each half against its own trigger — a verification of one is not evidence for the other.
Active count: 2 → **3**. Prior note follows.)*

*2026-08-18, later same day (**I-0131 + I-0132 ✅ Verified (user-approved) and
archived** to the new `Verified/Issue-verified-0131-0140.md` decade file, and removed from this file
in the same step. **I-0133 ruled and resolved:** the user chose *delete Apple's dead state, leave
Linux alone* — the property, its `loadAll` parameter, the write, the clear and the `ProjectSession`
plumbing are gone, each site commented so the omission reads as deliberate; ⚠️ **the schema field
stays** because Linux consumes it. ⚠️ **Ruling I-0133 surfaced a finding the original report missed,
now filed as I-0134 (🔴 Open):** Linux applies the scroll fraction *after* `centerCursor()`,
deliberately overriding it — so **Apple and Linux now disagree about what "restore where I was"
means.** Deliberately **not** settled inside a dead-code cleanup: it changes shipped, VNC-verified
EP-022 behaviour and belongs to EP-026 parity. **BUILD SUCCEEDED**, interop **93/93 macOS arm64**.
⚠️ **Active count is now 2** — I-0133 (Resolved - Not Verified) and I-0134 (Open). The prior note's
"Active count: 10 → 13" was already stale before this pass: those Issues had been verified and
archived without this line being updated. Prior note follows.)*

*2026-08-18 (**I-0132 both halves now 🟠 Implemented - Not Verified.** ⚠️ **The
reveal-on-selection-change half was REMOVED, not tuned** — the user's re-test found it scrolled the
navigator "a little bit up or down" on **every** click, because `scrollTo` **re-anchors an
already-visible row** rather than no-opping as my comment had claimed. Reveal now fires **`onAppear`
only**, which is the one moment it is needed (restore sets the selection before the view exists).
The **focus half is implemented**: `navigate(to:)` calls `loader.takeFocus()`, so a click or Return
hands the keyboard to the manuscript and the caret is visible. ⚠️ **Accepted trade, user-ruled:**
this ends arrow-key list browsing after the first click — *"Arrow browsing isn't strictly necessary.
Mouse Wheel and Trackpad Scrolling are still available."* **Tab-as-focus-advance is no longer needed
for this Issue.** Also filed **T-0417** (Scene/Chapter boundary navigation) — adopted into SP-102,
shipping as menu items because ⚠️ **no free macOS key combination exists.** **BUILD SUCCEEDED**,
interop **93/93 macOS arm64**. Prior note follows.)*

*2026-08-17, later same day (**I-0114–I-0117 ✅ Verified (user-approved) and archived** to
`Verified/Issue-verified-0111-0120.md` in the same step — verified live during the SP-102 / T-0415
world-availability runs, which exercised those exact surfaces. ✅ **They are now usable as evidence for
SP-100's AC pass**, which the prior note said they were not. **Also filed and fixed the same day:
I-0123–I-0129**, all from the user's live SP-102 runs. Active count: 10 → **13**. Prior note follows.)*

*2026-08-17 (**SP-106 closed — I-0121 and I-0122 ✅ Verified and archived** to the new
`Verified/Issue-verified-0121-0130.md` decade file, and their full entries removed from `Issue-backlog.md` in
the same step. Neither was ever listed in this file — both were tracked in `Issue-backlog.md` and the SP-106
sprint record. **This file is unchanged otherwise: the same 10 `Resolved - Not Verified` Issues remain
active**, including I-0114–I-0117, which are **not** evidence for any EP-031 AC until verified. Prior note
follows.)*

*2026-08-15 (docs cleanup — 48 verified Issues archived to decade files, 4 closed Issues
archived; 6 stale full entries (I-0064, I-0067–I-0071) reconciled against their authoritative table rows.
10 `Resolved - Not Verified` Issues remain active.)*
