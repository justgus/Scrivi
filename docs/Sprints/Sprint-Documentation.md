# Sprints - Index

This is the main index for all Scrivi Sprints. Sprints are fixed-duration iterations that group Tasks and Issues into focused units of work.

> **Related:** [Tasks (T)](../Tasks/Task-Documentation.md) | [Issues (I)](../Issues/Issue-Documentation.md) | [Epics (EP)](../Epics/Epic-Documentation.md)

## Organization

- **Sprint-active.md** — The currently active Sprint(s); normally one, but parallel sprints across different Epics are permitted
- **Closed/Sprint-SP-XXX.md** — Archived closed Sprints, one file each

## Active Sprints

**None.** SP-079 (EP-025 `[Linux]`) ✅ closed 2026-07-22 — see below. **EP-025 `[Linux]` Timeline Panel stays
🟡 Active** → next sprint **SP-080** (scene-dot drag + Time Delta Picker + chain propagation, AC3). Next
available sprint **SP-080**.

Last closed: **SP-079** (EP-025 `[Linux]` — **Timeline Panel**, opened the Epic) — ✅ **closed 2026-07-22
(Human-approved).** The read + layout + select core: a hideable **bottom** strip (`TimelinePanel`) with one dot
per scene in **story-time** order (chain-computed from new `ScriviBridge::getTimeline` + `getSceneStoryTime`
invokables), a **View ▸ Show Timeline** toggle (Ctrl+Alt+T) on the SP-077 menu bar, and bidirectional
**dot↔navigator selection** + tooltip. **EP-025 AC1 + AC2 Verified** live over VNC; container build green
(185/185, 0 warnings) + all Linux smokes PASS; `scrivi.h` untouched (timeline C ABI complete from EP-016).
Tasks T-0321–T-0324 all Verified. `Closed/Sprint-SP-079.md`.

Prior: **SP-078** (EP-024 `[Linux]` — **Scene Inspector Panel**, opened AND closed the Epic) — ✅
**closed 2026-07-22 (Human-approved).** A hideable right-side tabbed panel mirroring Apple EP-014 — a
`SceneInspector` (`QTabWidget`, one stub "Scene Entities" tab: title + "No entities yet." + disabled Add
Entity) docked as `EditorShell`'s **third splitter pane**, toggled from **View ▸ Show Inspector** (Ctrl+Alt+I,
checkable, editor-only) on the SP-077 menu bar; session-scoped, default **shown**, **120/200 width** (user
pref); window enlarged to **1020×760**. Verified live over VNC (T-0318–T-0320); container build green
(184/184, 0 warnings) + all Linux smokes PASS. Qt/C++ UI only — no `scrivi_*`/`scrivi.h`/Apple change; no new
headless smoke (pure UI). **This closed EP-024** in a single sprint, like Apple EP-014/SP-037.
`Closed/Sprint-SP-078.md`.

Prior: **SP-077** (`[Linux]` — **Native menu bar**) — ✅ **closed 2026-07-22 (Human-approved).** Built
a native `QMenuBar` on `ScriviWindow` (File/Edit/Scene/Chapter/Project) so every core op has a mouse-driven
trigger + shortcut hint. **This unblocked EP-028 AC5/AC6 Linux verification over VNC** — the macOS→VNC input
path swallows `Ctrl-Shift-Backspace` (Shift held; proven via key-log, not an app bug), so chapter-merge was
verified live via **Chapter ▸ Merge**. Also: File ▸ New/Open route to the landing page's create/open UI
(T-0314/T-0315); **flush-safe editor-leaving paths** closed a data-loss hole (Close/New/Open now flush first,
T-0316); Ctrl+W closes to landing (T-0317); TEMP diagnostics stripped (T-0313). Container build + smokes green;
full VNC walkthrough user-verified. Tasks T-0310–T-0317 all Verified. `Closed/Sprint-SP-077.md`.

Prior: **SP-076** (EP-028 `[Linux]` — **Scene & chapter merge parity**, the final EP-028 leg) — ✅ **closed
2026-07-22 (Human-approved).** Brought Linux to macOS parity: `Ctrl-Backspace` (scene) / `Ctrl-Shift-Backspace`
(chapter) merges backed by SP-074's `scrivi_merge_scene` / `scrivi_merge_chapter`, no confirmation, no-op at
manuscript start, reload-from-disk (I-0081-safe). Scene-merge verified live over VNC; chapter-merge verified
live via the SP-077 menu. Plus two Apple-parity extras surfaced in VNC testing: between-scene separator rule
(T-0308) + `Ctrl+Return` mid-scene split (T-0309). New `scene_merge_smoke` in CI; container build + smokes
green. Linux-only (Qt/C++); `scrivi.h`/ScriviCore untouched. Covered **AC5, AC6 (Linux), AC7** — **closed
EP-028**. Tasks T-0304–T-0309 all Verified. `Closed/Sprint-SP-076.md`.

Prior: **SP-075** (EP-028 `[Apple]` — **Adopt the merge endpoints**) — ✅ **closed 2026-07-21
(Human-approved).** Pointed the macOS `⌘-Backspace` / `⇧⌘-Backspace` merge commands at SP-074's endpoints
(retiring the `deleteChapter`-composed chapter-merge = the I-0083 cause); new `ScriviEngine.mergeScene`/
`mergeChapter` wrappers + `MergeSceneResult`/`MergeChapterResult`; `xcodebuild build`+`test` green (36/36
interop, incl. 4 new merge tests). Scene-merge join changed to blank-line (user-approved). **I-0083 & I-0084
Verified** (user GUI); **I-0085** closed Not-a-Bug (env. duplicate-instance + macOS 27.0 beta panel-XPC
timeout); **I-0086** `try?`-unused build warnings fixed. EP-028 AC1–AC4 complete. Tasks T-0302–T-0303.
`Closed/Sprint-SP-075.md`.

Prior: **SP-074** (EP-028 `[ScriviCore]` — **Merge endpoints + filesystem-coherence fix**) — ✅
**closed 2026-07-21 (Human-approved).** Two new atomic C ABI endpoints `scrivi_merge_scene` (`SceneMerger`) /
`scrivi_merge_chapter` (`ChapterMerger` — the atomic I-0083 fix: relocates scene files into the predecessor
BEFORE removing the emptied chapter). 11 merge tests incl. the I-0083 loss guard on the old
`deleteChapter`-composed path; ctest **macOS 317/317 + Linux 324/324**; both C symbols exported in
`libScriviCore.a`; `scrivi.h` boundary stayed pure C ABI. Fixed stale `devops/docker/linux/Dockerfile`
(missing `libssl-dev`). Tasks T-0298–T-0301. `Closed/Sprint-SP-074.md`.

Prior: **SP-073** (EP-023 `[Linux]` — **chapter drag-reorder AC5 + full EP-023 verify & Epic close**;
renumbered from the skipped SP-068) — ✅ **closed 2026-07-19 (Human-approved).** Chapter rows drag as
containers (CopyAction-only, boundary-only drop resolution, `SceneDocument::moveChapter` block splice,
post-reslug path refresh via new reorder-envelope paths; `scrivi.h` untouched). Fixed & Verified en route:
**I-0080** (`[ScriviCore]` open-time migration undid chapter reorders — legacy gate + eager index-cache
rebuild), **I-0081** (stale scene paths after drag broke rename/save), **I-0082** (non-selectable chapter
rows blocked the drag). ctest **306/306 macOS + 313/313 Linux**; **11/11** container smokes (new
`chapter_reorder_smoke` in CI). Tasks **T-0294–T-0297** Verified & archived. **This closed EP-023** (all
ACs AC1–AC8 Verified; `../Epics/Closed/Epic-EP-023.md`). `Closed/Sprint-SP-073.md`.

Prior: **SP-072** (EP-027 — **P5 Apple-verify migration fixes**; a real legacy project failed to open on
macOS with "Repair required: Missing scene content file"). — ✅ **closed 2026-07-18 (Human-approved).** Fixed
**I-0078** (macOS `createChapter` wrapper drifted behind `scrivi.h`'s `afterChapterID` — app hadn't compiled since
SP-071), **I-0076** (legacy scene `content.path` not bared on migration → dangling after chapter reslug;
`parseSceneMeta` now bares it + `migrateScenes` normalises stale sidecars), **I-0077** (chapter with index/sidecar
id mismatch dropped as phantom → path-folder fallback in `migrateChapterOrderKeys`). 2 regression tests, each proven
RED-without-fix. ctest **304/304 macOS, 311/311 Linux**; Human opened a fresh copy of the real project → clean.
**AC7+AC8 Verified.** Tasks **T-0290–T-0293**. `Closed/Sprint-SP-072.md`.

Prior: **SP-071** (EP-027/EP-023 — **create-chapter-in-place**; fixes the Linux chapter-split
lost-tail/folder-scramble + open-time scene-stealing, **I-0074**; arrows cross scene/chapter boundaries, **I-0075**)
— ✅ **closed 2026-07-18 (Human-approved).** `createChapter(afterChapterID)` (additive `scrivi.h` change) so the
new chapter is born in place — no create-then-reorder, no stale path; scene cache is a pure disk mirror + removed
the unsafe filename-based orphan relocation (order-key scene filenames repeat across chapters). Split dialog removed
(Ctrl+Shift+Return is the approval). **Verified over VNC** (all four split cases update + reopen clean; arrow nav
fixed). ctest **302/302** macOS. Tasks **T-0279–T-0289**. `Closed/Sprint-SP-071.md`. Prior: **SP-067** (EP-023 `[Linux]` Scene drag-reorder + I-0064 chapter-split + I-0063 renumber) — ✅
**closed 2026-07-16**. Delivered **AC4 scene drag-reorder** (I-0067/I-0068 fixed by forcing the drag to
`Qt::CopyAction` so Qt never auto-removes the source row; user-verified "It's clean" on a fresh project over VNC)
and **I-0063** renumber (T-0262, Verified). The chapter-split pieces — **I-0064/I-0069/I-0070**, the root slug
corruption **I-0072**, and **I-0071** — were **re-homed to the new EP-027** (rebuilt on its filesystem-authoritative
on-disk model rather than fixed twice). Follow-on **I-0073** (VNC drag-hover lag, likely environmental) flagged.
`Closed/Sprint-SP-067.md`. Prior: **SP-066** (EP-023 rename + I-0062) ✅ closed 2026-07-15. SP-056/SP-057 (EP-019
`[Apple]`) remain in Planning, parked behind the deferred EP-019 — see Backlog.

*Last Updated: 2026-07-22 (**SP-079 ✅ closed with user approval** — EP-025 `[Linux]` Timeline Panel's first
sprint, planned + activated + implemented + verified + closed same day. Delivered the timeline read + layout +
select core: a hideable bottom `TimelinePanel` strip with one scene dot per scene in story-time order
(chain-computed from new `ScriviBridge::getTimeline` + `getSceneStoryTime` invokables), a View ▸ Show Timeline
toggle (Ctrl+Alt+T) on the SP-077 menu bar, and bidirectional dot↔navigator selection + tooltip. T-0321–T-0324
all ✅ Verified live over VNC; **AC1 + AC2 met**; container build green (185/185, 0 warnings) + all Linux smokes
PASS; `scrivi.h` untouched. Closed 74→75, Active 1→0 — no active sprint; **EP-025 stays Active** → SP-080
(scene-dot drag + Time Delta Picker, AC3). Next available SP-080. Record: `Closed/Sprint-SP-079.md`. Prior note
follows.)*

*2026-07-22 (**SP-078 ✅ closed with user approval** — EP-024 `[Linux]` Scene Inspector Panel,
planned + activated + implemented + verified + closed same day (mirroring Apple EP-014/SP-037). A hideable
right-side `QTabWidget` panel docked as `EditorShell`'s third splitter pane, a stub "Scene Entities" tab, and
a View ▸ Show Inspector toggle (Ctrl+Alt+I) on the SP-077 menu bar; session-scoped, default shown, 120/200
width (user pref); window enlarged to 1020×760. T-0318–T-0320 all ✅ Verified live over VNC; container build
green (184/184, 0 warnings) + all Linux smokes PASS. Qt/C++ UI only — no `scrivi_*`/`scrivi.h`/Apple change.
**This closed EP-024.** Closed 73→74, Active 1→0 — no active sprint, no Active Epic; next available SP-079.
Record: `Closed/Sprint-SP-078.md`. Prior note follows.)*

*2026-07-22 (**SP-076 + SP-077 ✅ both closed with user approval** — the final EP-028 `[Linux]`
legs. **SP-076** delivered scene & chapter merge parity (`Ctrl-Backspace`/`Ctrl-Shift-Backspace`, reload-from-disk,
no confirmation) + between-scene separator rule + `Ctrl+Return` mid-scene split; scene-merge live over VNC,
chapter-merge live via the SP-077 menu; new `scene_merge_smoke` in CI. **SP-077** delivered the native menu bar
(File/Edit/Scene/Chapter/Project) that made chapter-merge verifiable over VNC (macOS→VNC swallows
`Ctrl-Shift-Backspace`), plus flush-safe editor-leaving paths (closed a data-loss hole) + Ctrl+W. **This closed
EP-028** — AC5/AC6/AC7 Verified (AC1–AC4 already Verified from SP-074/SP-075). Closed 71→73, Active 1→0 —
**no active sprint, no Active Epic**; next available **SP-078**. Records: `Closed/Sprint-SP-076.md`,
`Closed/Sprint-SP-077.md`. Prior note follows.)*

*2026-07-19 (**SP-073 ✅ closed with user approval** — EP-023 `[Linux]`'s final sprint,
planned + activated + implemented + verified + closed same day (renumbered from the skipped SP-068):
**AC5 chapter drag-reorder** (chapter-as-container, CopyAction-only, boundary drop resolution,
`SceneDocument::moveChapter` block splice, post-reslug path refresh via the new reorder-envelope paths) +
full EP-023 verify AC6–AC8. Three defects found & fixed & Verified en route: **I-0080** (`[ScriviCore]`
open-time migration undid chapter reorders — legacy gate + eager index-cache rebuild), **I-0081** (stale
scene paths after drag broke rename/save — envelope now reports post-move paths), **I-0082** (undraggable
non-selectable chapter rows). New `chapter_reorder_smoke` + extended `scene_reorder_smoke` in CI; ctest
**306/306 macOS + 313/313 Linux**; `scrivi.h` untouched. T-0294–T-0297 Verified & archived to
`Tasks/Verified/Task-verified-0294-0297.md`. **This closed EP-023** (all ACs; `Epics/Closed/Epic-EP-023.md`).
Closed 68→69, Active 1→0 — no active sprint, no Active Epic; next available **SP-074**. Record:
`Closed/Sprint-SP-073.md`. Prior note follows.)*

*2026-07-16 (**SP-067 ✅ closed** with user approval — EP-023 `[Linux]` third sprint: delivered
**AC4 scene drag-reorder** (I-0067/I-0068 fixed via `Qt::CopyAction`, VNC-verified on a fresh project) + **I-0063**
renumber (Verified); the chapter-split defects **I-0064/I-0069/I-0070**, the root slug corruption **I-0072**, and
**I-0071** were **re-homed to the new EP-027** `[ScriviCore]` (rebuilt on its filesystem-authoritative model);
follow-on **I-0073** (VNC drag lag) flagged. Closed 62→63, Active 1→0, next available SP-068. Two Epics now Active
(EP-027 `[ScriviCore]`, EP-023 `[Linux]`); recommended next start EP-027 P1. Earlier: **SP-066 ✅ closed** with user approval — EP-023 `[Linux]` rename scene/chapter
(context menu + `QInputDialog` edit + live label/heading + app-derived "Chapter N" ordinal); tasks
T-0254–T-0257 all Verified over VNC & archived to `Tasks/Verified/Task-verified-0254-0257.md`; delivered EP-023
**AC3** + **I-0062 Resolved-Verified**; all 9 headless smokes green; no ScriviCore work (`scrivi.h` untouched).
Closed 61→62, Active 1→0. **EP-023 stays 🟡 Active** — SP-067 reorder (+ I-0064 chapter-split + I-0063 renumber)
