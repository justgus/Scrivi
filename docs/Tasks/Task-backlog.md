## T-0175: Spotlight Integration (umbrella) — Superseded by EP-017

**Status:** ⚪ Superseded
**Date Requested:** 2026-06-23 | **Superseded:** 2026-06-23
**Epic:** EP-017

Originally logged as a single design-gated task. Per user direction it was expanded into a full
Epic — **EP-017: Spotlight Search Integration** — and decomposed into Sprints SP-044–SP-047 and
Tasks T-0176–T-0190. See `docs/Epics/Epic-backlog.md` (EP-017) and
`docs/Scrivi_Spotlight_Integration_Design_v0_1.md`. This entry is retained as a pointer; no work
is tracked under T-0175.

## EP-017 Spotlight Tasks (T-0176 – T-0190)

Design reference for every task: `docs/Scrivi_Spotlight_Integration_Design_v0_1.md`. Sprint-level
acceptance criteria live in `docs/Sprints/Sprint-backlog.md`; Epic-level ACs in
`docs/Epics/Epic-backlog.md` (EP-017).

### SP-044 — Design sign-off & ScriviCore indexing facade — ✅ Closed & Verified (2026-06-23)

T-0176–T-0179 verified and archived. Full detail:
[T-0176](Verified/Task-verified-0176.md) · [T-0177](Verified/Task-verified-0177.md) ·
[T-0178](Verified/Task-verified-0178.md) · [T-0179](Verified/Task-verified-0179.md).
Sprint retrospective: `docs/Sprints/Closed/Sprint-SP-044.md`.

### SP-045 — Layer 1: in-app Core Spotlight donations & deep-link

**T-0180 — Entitlements + project config.** ✅ Verified & archived 2026-06-23 — enabled the App
Sandbox capability (the Core Spotlight prerequisite) + `scrivi://` URL scheme; verified by a clean
open→write→save→close cycle under the sandbox (no Console `deny`). Full detail:
[Task-verified-0180.md](Verified/Task-verified-0180.md). *Note:* whether the original
`CSInlineDonation` console errors are resolved is checked later at EP-017 AC9 / T-0189 (needs live
donations, T-0182).

**T-0181 — `ScriviEngine` indexable-records API.** ✅ Verified & archived 2026-06-23 — added
`ScriviEngine.extractSearchableText` + `SearchableContentResult`/`SearchableItemResult` decode types
(pure decode, no backend logic in Swift); proven by interop test #18 (`xcodebuild test` 22/22 green).
Also wired `ScriviInteropTests` into the `ScriviApp` scheme so the whole suite runs from CLI/CI, and
fixed two latent git tests broken under the sandboxed test host. Full detail:
[Task-verified-0181.md](Verified/Task-verified-0181.md).

**T-0182 — Donate / update / delete.** ✅ Verified & archived 2026-06-23 — `SpotlightDonor` donates
on open/save and deletes by domain on close, wired into `AppEnvironment`; the Swift donation path was
proven correct in the debugger (extract→24 records→donate). **Known environment limitation:** the OS
rejects the donations (`SetStoreUpdateService` -4099) on the dev-signed sandboxed build, so nothing
indexes yet — confirmed not our logic / not a debugger artifact / not a hard sandbox deny; deferred to
T-0189 to confirm on a provisioned/installed build (also where AC9 is judged). Full detail:
[Task-verified-0182.md](Verified/Task-verified-0182.md).

**T-0183 — Markdown→plain-text extraction.** ✅ Verified & archived 2026-06-23 — no new code needed:
the `util/MarkdownStrip` core + facade application shipped under T-0178 (per design §4b it lives in
the ScriviCore facade, shared by both layers; Swift does no Markdown handling). Covered by the
MarkdownStrip unit tests + interop test #18. Full detail:
[Task-verified-0183.md](Verified/Task-verified-0183.md).

**T-0184 — Deep-link continuation.** Each item carries a `scrivi://open?project=…&item=…` URL.
App handles `CSSearchableItemActionType` / URL scheme to open the project and select the item.
*Implemented 2026-06-23 (not verified):* `ScriviDeepLink` (URL parse, 4 unit tests) +
`ProjectBookmarkStore` (projectID→security-scoped bookmark — the bookmark work deferred from T-0180:
recorded on panel-open, resolved/refreshed/released around a deep-link open). `AppEnvironment.handleDeepLink`
(URL-scheme path: select-if-open, else resolve bookmark → reopen → select; clear message if no
bookmark) + `handleSpotlightItem` (best-effort continuation). `ScriviApp` wires `onOpenURL` +
`onContinueUserActivity(CSSearchableItemActionType)`; `ManuscriptEditorView` consumes
`pendingNavigationSceneID` into its existing `navigateToSceneID`. pbxproj updated (2 new files, all
3 app targets). macOS build clean; `xcodebuild test` 26/26.
**Known limits (inherent):** (1) cold-start resolves only projects opened before in this app (sandbox
bookmark requirement); (2) the Spotlight-tap continuation carries only the item `uniqueIdentifier`
(no projectID for scenes) and is unreliable on SwiftUI macOS, so `scene:` taps only select when the
project is already open — the `scrivi://` URL scheme is the complete route.
**Verification (overlaps T-0189):** end-to-end from a tapped Spotlight result needs donations to index
first (blocked by T-0182 env issue). URL-scheme path is testable now via
`open "scrivi://open?project=<id>&item=scene:<id>"` against a previously-opened project on a build that
receives URL events.

**T-0184 resumed & completed on the per-window model (2026-06-25 — Implemented, Not Verified).**
EP-018 unblocked this. The core deep link (open/focus the right window, select scene by `scene_…` ID)
was already verified via EP-018 / T-0196. The remaining Spotlight-result *continuation* path
(`onContinueUserActivity(CSSearchableItemActionType)`) was finished and hardened:
- `handleSpotlightItem` now accepts an optional `relatedURL` and **prefers the full donated deep link**
  (`SpotlightDonor` sets it as `relatedUniqueIdentifier`). Because that URL carries the **projectID**,
  a tapped `scene:` result can now open even a **closed** project (via its bookmark) — removing the old
  inherent limit where scene taps only worked when the project was already open. Falls back to the
  uid-only logic when no related URL is present. (`AppEnvironment.swift:344-385`)
- `ScriviApp` recovers that URL from `activity.contentAttributeSet?.relatedUniqueIdentifier` and passes
  it through. (`ScriviApp.swift:189-199`)
- No new files. macOS `ScriviApp` build clean; interop suite 26/26 (incl. `ScriviDeepLink` parse).
**Still not user-verified:** the live Spotlight-tap continuation depends on donations indexing
(the T-0182 `SetStoreUpdateService` env issue) and is acknowledged unreliable on SwiftUI macOS; the
`scrivi://` URL scheme remains the fully-verified route. Full end-to-end Spotlight-tap verification is
T-0189 (SP-047).

### SP-046 — Layer 2: on-disk `.scrivi` importer extension — Implemented, Not Verified (2026-06-30)

All four implemented; macOS `ScriviApp` scheme builds clean and the OS registered the Spotlight
extension on install. Awaiting live verification (Spotlight finds `.scrivi` content with the app
closed).

**T-0185 — Importer extension target.** ✅ New macOS app-extension target **ScriviSpotlightImporter**
(bundle `com.caposoft.scrivi.ScriviSpotlightImporter`), created via Xcode's **Spotlight Importer**
template (`CSImportExtension`) and embedded in `ScriviApp`. Authored by Xcode, so the target +
`ImportExtension.swift` + `Info.plist` are managed in `project.pbxproj` by Xcode (no hand-edit; the
CLAUDE.md pbxproj rule applies to *hand-created* files, none here).

**T-0186 — Link ScriviCore (Option A).** ✅ Mirrors the app's recipe via Build Settings on the
extension: own `Build ScriviCore (CMake)` run-script phase → `build/ScriviCore/libScriviCore.a`;
`LIBRARY_SEARCH_PATHS=$(SRCROOT)/build/ScriviCore`, `OTHER_LDFLAGS=-lScriviCore -lc++`,
`SWIFT_INCLUDE_PATHS=$(SRCROOT)/ScriviCore/include/scrivi` (so `import ScriviCore` resolves the C
module). **Required `ENABLE_USER_SCRIPT_SANDBOXING=NO`** (matching the app) — the default `YES`
sandboxed the run-script and made CMake fail to read the root `CMakeLists.txt`.

**T-0187 — Emit attributes from facade JSON.** ✅ `ImportExtension.update(_:forFileAt:)` calls
`scrivi_extract_searchable_text(path)` (same facade as Layer 1; `scrivi_free`'d), decodes the
`scrivi.searchableContent.v1` envelope, and emits one `CSSearchableItemAttributeSet`:
`displayName` = project title; `textContent` = every record's title + description folded together
(so any scene/object content surfaces the package); `keywords` = deduped union. **Note:**
`CSImportExtension` indexes the package as a **single** item, so per-scene deep-linking stays Layer 1's
job (the in-app `CSSearchableIndex` donor) — this on-disk layer makes content findable, by design.

**T-0188 — UTI handling + sandbox.** ✅ `Info.plist` `CSSupportedContentTypes` =
`com.caposoft.scrivi.project` (the app exports this UTI), `CSExtensionLabel` = "Scrivi Project
Importer". Extension runs in the App Sandbox with **User Selected File = Read Only**. Perf pass on a
large fixture deferred to verification.

### SP-047 — Verification, cross-platform assessment, Epic close

**T-0189 — End-to-end verification.** With Scrivi closed, Spotlight finds project/scene/object
content; selecting a result opens Scrivi at the item; donations now succeed so the original
`CSInlineDonation … SetStoreUpdateService` errors no longer appear (or are documented benign);
no regression to open/save/close.

**T-0190 — Cross-platform assessment + EP-017 verification.** Assess iOS/iPadOS/visionOS use of
the shared Core Spotlight APIs; implement or explicitly defer with rationale. Run final EP-017
acceptance-criteria verification and prepare the Epic for close.

## EP-018 Per-Window / Per-Project Window Model Tasks (T-0191 – T-0196)

Design: `docs/Scrivi_PerWindow_Project_Model_Design_v0_1.md` (✅ approved 2026-06-24). Swift-layer
only; no ScriviCore/C++ changes. The V1 spike (T-0191) gates the R3 mechanism before any
production refactor commits.

### SP-048 — Foundation (spike, ProjectSession, registry)

**T-0191 — V1 spike. ✅ Done 2026-06-24.** Throwaway `#if SPIKE_T0191` block in `ScriviApp.swift`
(built, run, observed, removed). **Result:** macOS 26 `WindowGroup(for:)` de-dups by value **only
against already-established windows; NOT race-safe** — two `openWindow(value:)` for the same value
in quick succession produced two windows; re-opening an already-open value focused it.
**Decision:** `OpenProjectRegistry` (T-0193) is the **authoritative R3 guard** (check-and-focus
before `openWindow`); native de-dup is a steady-state backstop only. Critical for restore-all
(T-0195) and deep links, which open windows concurrently. Recorded in design doc §3.2 and SP-048
notes.

**T-0192 — Extract `ProjectSession`.** Move all per-project state (`openProjectResult`,
`viewportLoader`, `projectPreferences`, `timelineModel`, `pendingNavigationSceneID`,
`spotlightDomainIdentifier`, `deepLinkAccessURL`, per-window UI flags) and the `openProject` /
`closeProject` / `onAppResign` / `donateSpotlight` methods off `AppEnvironment` onto a new
`@Observable @MainActor ProjectSession`. Behavior-preserving — app stays single-window this
sprint. New `.swift` files added to `project.pbxproj` in the same step (CLAUDE.md).

**T-0193 — `OpenProjectRegistry`.** Add an `@Observable` registry to `AppEnvironment` mapping
`projectID → ProjectSession`, with register/deregister/lookup. Powers R3 (already-open check) and
R4 (restore manifest). Not yet wired to windowing.

### SP-049 — Windowing & restore

**T-0194 — `WindowGroup(for:)` + Landing window.** Convert the scene to
`WindowGroup(for: ProjectWindowID.self)`; add a Landing/picker window for the no-project state;
open/focus projects via `openWindow(value:)`. Achieves R1/R2/R3 using the T-0191-chosen
mechanism.

**T-0195 — Manifest + restore-all.** Persist the set of open projectIDs (+ frontmost) to
UserDefaults; on launch, resolve each via `ProjectBookmarkStore` (reused from T-0184) and
`openWindow` to restore **all** previously-open windows (Q1). Per-window scene/cursor/scroll
restored by the existing backend open flow — no backend change.

### SP-050 — Deep-link rewrite & verification

**T-0196 — Deep-link rewrite + EP-018 verification.** Rebuild the paused T-0184 handler on the
new model: resolve projectID → registry → focus existing window or `openWindow` → set
`pendingNavigationSceneID` on that window's session. Fix scene matching to use the `scene_…` ID
(not title). Keep `ScriviDeepLink` / `ProjectBookmarkStore` / `SpotlightDonor`. Cross-reference
the per-window model from `Scrivi_Project_Creation_and_Open_Flow_v0_2.md`. Run EP-018 R1–R5
verification; unblock EP-017 AC5.

*Last Updated: 2026-06-29 (T-0123 removed from backlog — Verified and archived to Verified/Task-verified-0123.md; EP-012 closed.)*
