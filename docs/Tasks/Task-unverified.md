# Unverified Tasks

Tasks that are **implemented and awaiting user verification** before being archived to `Verified/`.

**Claude may mark a Task `Implemented - Not Verified`. Only the user can mark it Verified.**

⚠️ This file must not disagree with [`Task-active.md`](Task-active.md) or
[`Task-backlog.md`](Task-backlog.md). A Task implemented but unverified belongs **here** — not left
in the backlog carrying a 🟠 status.

## 🟠 T-0616 — `[Cross]` EP-053 S3: structural cut, Backspace / Delete over scenes, and their undo

**Epic:** [EP-053] (S3) · **Status:** 🟠 **Implemented - Not Verified** (2026-10-22) — ⏳ Mac and rig live passes ([SP-188] AC11) · **Sprint:** [SP-188] (🟡 Active) →
[`../Sprints/Sprint-SP-188.md`](../Sprints/Sprint-SP-188.md) · **Date Requested:** 2026-10-20 (user: *"complete planning for EP-053"*)

**What:** on the Mac and on Linux, a cut, buffer cut, or Backspace / Delete across scenes removes the structure (design R4,
§4.3, Q2, Q4) through one `scrivi_range_cut` off the main thread, the delta applied, no reload; undo is a range paste
(`rangeCut` node), redo the cut. The core balances the cut's join and returns the markers it added, so the undo is exact.
The clipboard (or slot) holds the cut's returned Range with its sidecars; a selection crossing a divider takes that scene
whole; Backspace over one scene divider merges; paste over a cross-scene selection is the cut, then the paste. Old
`structuredCut` nodes and [I-0270]'s grouped deletes still undo. Retires both platforms' `deleteAcrossScenes`.

**Done (2026-10-22):** ScriviCore (`RangeJoin`, the balanced join in `cut()`, applied and checked in `paste()`); the Mac
(`selectionRun`, `cutAcrossScenes(_:keeping:then:)`) and Linux (`ManuscriptEditor::selectionRun`,
`EditorShell::cutAcrossScenes`) — every cross-scene cut, Backspace / Delete and paste-over one range call off the main
thread, the delta applied, undone in one step; `deleteAcrossScenes` retired on both. ctest 763 (Mac) / 767 (Linux),
interop 311, Linux smokes 38; mutations core 6, Mac 8, Linux 7, all caught.
