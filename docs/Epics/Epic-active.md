## EP-016: Timeline Panel — Full Implementation

**Status:** 🟡 Active
**Goal:** Deliver the fully functional Timeline Panel as specified in `Scrivi_Timeline_Panel_Design_v0_3.md`. This includes the ScriviCore persistence layer (timeline meta, scene story-time, story structure bands, historical events, imported timelines), all ScriviCore API operations, the rebuilt SwiftUI `TimelineStripView`, the Time Delta Picker, and the Story Structure band overlay.
**Date Created:** 2026-06-11
**Target Close Date:** TBD
**Actual Close Date:** —

### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] A project with no scenes shows an empty timeline panel with the correct empty-state message.
- [ ] A project with scenes shows one dot per scene on a horizontal line, positioned in manuscript order by default, vertically centered in the panel.
- [ ] `timeline.meta.json` is created in `objects/timelines/` when a new project is created.
- [ ] Each scene's `scene.meta.json` contains a `storyTime` block with `offsetMs`, `offsetSource`, `durationMs`, `durationSource`, `inferenceHint`, `inferenceConfidence`, and `storyStructure` fields.
- [ ] `project.json` contains a `timelineDefaults` block with `defaultSceneDurationMs` (default 1 hour) and `dragPositioningMode` (default "proportional").
- [ ] New scenes default to `durationMs = defaultSceneDurationMs` and `offsetSource = "default"` (immediately after the previous scene).
- [ ] The default timeline spans `n × defaultSceneDurationMs` for `n` scenes with no manual positioning.
- [ ] A writer can drag a scene dot horizontally; on release the Time Delta Picker appears with the spinner pre-populated, a scene duration row, and "Immediately after" option.
- [ ] Committing a position or duration change to scene N silently recomputes the `offsetMs` of all subsequent default-positioned scenes (chain propagation).
- [ ] "Immediately after" in the picker sets `offsetSource = "default"`, returning the scene to the chain.
- [ ] "Keep position" and "Reset" options in the Time Delta Picker behave correctly.
- [ ] "Set Time Delta…" in the scene dot context menu opens the picker without a drag gesture.
- [ ] Dot tooltip shows human-readable story-time duration relative to epoch (e.g., "3 days, 4 hours after Story Open").
- [ ] Applying a Story Structure writes `objects/story-structures/story-structure.json` and renders colored bands with labels in the panel.
- [ ] Band borders are draggable; proportions update correctly and persist.
- [ ] A scene dot can be assigned to a band by dragging it vertically to the band label row; the dot displays a colored ring.
- [ ] A scene dot can be assigned to a band via the context menu "Assign to Act…" with the same result.
- [ ] Removing a Story Structure removes band rendering but preserves all `offsetMs` values and `bandID` assignments in scene metadata.
- [ ] A writer can author a historical event; it persists in `objects/historical-events/` and appears as a `#C8A97A` dot on the timeline.
- [ ] A writer can import a `.scrivi-timeline.json` file; its events appear as a distinct grey row below the project row.
- [ ] Only events within the current project timeline window are shown from imported timelines.
- [ ] Multiple imported timelines appear as distinct rows with distinct grey shades.
- [ ] A writer can export the project timeline as a `.scrivi-timeline.json` file.
- [ ] The panel resizes by dragging its top edge; minimum height is maintained dynamically.
- [ ] Multiple co-located scene dots form a hexagonal cluster expanding upward from the line.
- [ ] Timeline panel is absent on iPhone idiom.
- [ ] All timeline data persists correctly across project close/reopen.
