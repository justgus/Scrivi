## EP-019: Custom Undo/Redo History & Multiple Copy Buffers

**Status:** 🟡 Active (design ✅ approved 2026-07-06; SP-051/SP-052/SP-053 ✅ closed — **AC1 delivered & verified** 2026-07-07; **SP-054 ✅ closed 2026-07-09 — AC3 + AC5 delivered & verified** (AC5 branch-purge clauses deferred to SP-055). Next: SP-055, Planning)
**Goal:** Replace the broken native undo (I-0019) with a from-scratch, sentence-granular undo/redo system backed by a tree-structured, per-project, on-disk persistent history (cross-session undo with session-boundary warning; branching with primary-line selection; capacity eviction and stale-branch purge), plus vim/emacs-register-style multiple copy buffers whose pastes are history events.
**Design:** `docs/Scrivi_UndoRedo_History_and_Copy_Buffers_Design_v0_1.md` (v0.1 ✅ Approved baseline 2026-07-06 — trades ruled: T1=B, T2=A+refinements, T3=C, T4=B+D+A, T5=C, T6=A)
**Supersedes:** I-0019 (Undo/Redo have no effect — ⚪ Closed 2026-07-06, OBE/superseded by this Epic, user-approved; see `docs/Issues/Closed/Issue-closed-0019.md`. AC1 carries the requirement; delivery target SP-053. Re-open I-0019 if EP-019 is cancelled or AC1 descoped.)
**Date Created:** 2026-07-06
**Target Close Date:** TBD (7 sprints)
**Actual Close Date:** —

### Acceptance Criteria

- [x] AC1 — ⌘Z/⇧⌘Z work in the macOS manuscript editor: repeated ⌘Z walks back one history event at a time; ⇧⌘Z re-applies (**delivers the fix formerly tracked as I-0019**). ✅ **Verified live 2026-07-07** (SP-053; `Tasks/Verified/Task-verified-0204-0206.md`).
- [ ] AC2 — Events commit exactly per the design's event model (`.` `!` `?`, Return, cursor-move-with-pending-changes, paste/cut, scene switch, flush); cursor moves/newlines without text changes produce **no** event.
- [x] AC3 — History persists across quit/relaunch; undoing past the session boundary shows a warning (once per crossing) before proceeding. ✅ **Verified 2026-07-09** (SP-054; `Tasks/Verified/Task-verified-0207-0209.md`).
- [ ] AC4 — Undo-then-type creates a branch; the new line becomes primary; the old branch is selectable at the fork and becomes primary when selected; abandoned text fully restorable.
- [x] AC5 — History capacity configurable (per Trade T1); oldest events fall off at capacity; branches auto-purge when their branch point ages off; stale branches detectable and purgeable with user confirmation. ✅ **Verified 2026-07-09** (SP-054 — capacity config + linear eviction of the root→current path; `Tasks/Verified/Task-verified-0207-0209.md`). ⚠️ **Branch-aware auto-purge + stale-branch detection/confirmation land in SP-055** (no branching exists yet); re-confirm the branch clauses at SP-055 close.
- [ ] AC6 — Copy buffers: ≥ 2 buffers loadable and pasteable at multiple locations (design CONOPS §9.a); each paste is one undo step; system pasteboard unaffected; buffers persist across relaunch.
- [ ] AC7 — Structural operations record barriers; undo stops at a barrier with a clear notice; no text corruption.
- [ ] AC8 — No regression: auto-save, scene navigation, structure ops, external-change scan, Git snapshots unchanged; backend `ctest` + interop suites green.

### Issues

| ID | Title | Status |
| -- | ----- | ------ |
| I-0019 | Undo and Redo have no effect in the manuscript editor | ⚪ Closed 2026-07-06 — OBE/superseded by this Epic (user-approved); requirement lives on as AC1 → `docs/Issues/Closed/Issue-closed-0019.md` |

### Scope Notes

- Structural undo (scene/chapter create/delete/merge/reorder) is explicitly **out of scope** — those operations record history *barriers* in v1 (design §4.5); full structural undo is a documented future extension.
- iOS/iPadOS capture layer deferred (editor is a stub); the C++ engine and ABI are platform-neutral by construction.
- All six trade-study decisions **approved by the user 2026-07-06**: T1=B (capacity in Project
  settings), T2=A with interaction refinements (popover on undo-landing-at-fork, suppressed when
  undoing past, immediate on redo, redo-past takes primary, branch relegation — design §10 T2, §5),
  T3=C (copy-into-buffer not an event; cut is), T4=B+D with A for discoverability, T5=C
  (project-open session + idle rollover), T6=A (history inside package, gitignored).
